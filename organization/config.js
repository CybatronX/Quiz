		content:"<p>In Courtney Cox&rsquo;s character on&nbsp;<em>Friends</em>, you saw yourself; you&rsquo;re so clutter conscious and storage smart that <em>you&rsquo;d make&nbsp;Martha Stewart&nbsp;jealous</em>. <strong>You obsessively organize, compulsively clean and are reckless only in your expectation that others maintain that same standard of spotlessness.&nbsp;</strong><br /><br />Everything has its place and your blood boils a bit when an item isn&rsquo;t where you left it. Ruled by discipline, schedules and lists, your routines run like clockwork, even on the weekends. But in a world where not everyone marches to your impeccable drum, you&rsquo;re left to compromise with whomever shares your home.&nbsp;<br /><br />So how can you cope with other people&rsquo;s clutter? Create zones that allow you to keep your order away from others&rsquo; chaos and, in shared spaces, use labels to help your family remember where things go.<br />&nbsp;</p>",

People call you the <strong>new space cowboy</strong> (at least they should) for your constant jockeying between surrounding yourself with the knick-knacks you love and eliminating clutter for a crisp and clean home.&nbsp;<br /><br />As a result, <u>you&rsquo;re almost a pro at repurposing your dishes, vases, cups, jars and trays to display your favourite collectibles</u>. You&rsquo;re an organizing product junkie and, admittedly, your systems are sometimes more numerous than the possessions you were trying to simplify at the start.&nbsp;<br /><br />In short, you <u style='font-size:24px'><strong>over-organize</strong></u>. Keep it straightforward and, when you can, opt for two-in-ones (all-purpose cleaners, shampoo/conditioner, day-to-night creams) to cull down the clutter a little further.</p>",

Your home is never ready for an impromptu visit and you fear the thought of people peeking into your disastrous drawers.&nbsp;</p><p>In fact, you dread digging through them yourself, as you&rsquo;re bound to find anything, from batteries (used or unused, you don&rsquo;t know) and stale chocolate (why couldn&rsquo;t you find it during last night&rsquo;s candy craving?) to an open lipstick container (that&rsquo;s smeared all over the drawer) and kids&rsquo; toys (whose kids!?).&nbsp;</p><p>Nothing looks like it&rsquo;s in its place, but, mark your words, you know where everything is and the only time you lose it is when you&rsquo;ve &ldquo;put it away.&rdquo; You&rsquo;re a visual person, so if something isn&rsquo;t in sight, you&rsquo;ll forget it&rsquo;s there. Clear containers, open storage and colour-coded filing are key for you to visualize the path to an organized home.</p>",
